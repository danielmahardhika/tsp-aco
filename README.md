# Optimized TSP with ACO

## Description
This document explains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm aims to find the shortest path that visits a number of points (cities) and returns to the starting point.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**
   - Explanation of TSP and ACO.
  
2. **Installation**
   - How to install the necessary dependencies to run the notebook.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Usage**
   - How to run the notebook:
     1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
     2. Execute the code cells to configure and run the ACO algorithm.

4. **Results**
   - Results from several trials with evaluations of the best distances found by the algorithm.

5. **Images**
   - Visualizations of the results from the ACO algorithm.

## Example Results
Each trial produces evaluations and the best distances, for example:
```
--- Trial 1 ---
Evaluation: 50, Best Distance: 8134.90
...
```
